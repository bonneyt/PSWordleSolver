# PSWordleSolver
Powershell script that uses selenium and chrome driver to auto solve Wordle

Paths and locations may need to be updated.  The script automatically goes to the wordle page and attempts to solve

disclaimer... my code is a bit messy.  i did this for fun, mainly to see if i could figure it out!

make sure you install the latest selenium module

Install-Module selenium

download chrome driver that matches your browser's version

https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

i put both the webdriver.dll from the selinium module and chromedriver.exe in a folder on my C drive as the "working directory"
